This was my first ever project after learning to code. 

Literally just went nuts after learning loops, functions, and class!! 
Found it in a corner of a drive :') Brought up a lot of memory ngl.

Just install pygame and run the main file. You will chase someone and attack him!!! 
(Inspired by the Dabang movie by Salman Khan, don't ask :) )

Very noob code. Just keeping it for nostalgic reasons.
